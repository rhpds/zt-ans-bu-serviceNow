= 1.2 - Creating your first Project


A *https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/projects.html[Project, window=_blank]* in automation controller is one or more Ansible playbooks inside a directory or Source Control Management system.

We use *Projects* to "*import*" our playbooks into automation controller. These playbooks might be in a source control management (SCM) like Git (in Github or Gitlab for ex.) or locally. Automation controller doesn't allow us to create or edit playbooks through the web-UI, we can only "*import*" them into *Projects* which we later run through the Job Templates feature, which we will review further ahead.

In this challenge, you will create your first *Project* which will import a Github repository with a few Apache playbooks developed in the "Writing your first playbook" laboratory. This playbook installs apache, starts the service and copies an index.html file.
